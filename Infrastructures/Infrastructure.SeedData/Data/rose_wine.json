    "Name": "COTES DE PROVENCE, VILLA GARREL",
    "Description": "In the 16th century, the Villa Garrel was part of the former fief of Piegros. Today, Château de l’Aumérade Cru Classé is the jewel of the Fabre properties. Completely renovated, it now houses the head office of Fabre en Provence. The initials HF, engraved in one of the stones of the bastide, date from the Emperor Napoleon III (1868).Today, the vintners have the most modern equipment available with which to work, and craft an array of outstanding wines — including one for which Provence is perhaps best known: a fresh and juicy rosé.Crafted from three grape varieties — Grenache, Cinsault and Syrah — the 2018 Villa Garrel Rosé is a delightful wine with strawberry and papaya flavors that cascade into a long and creamy finish. It’s a wonderful wine for sipping on a hot summer day, or makes a great companion to summer salads.Pale pink, fruit-forward and refreshing rosé, crafted from Grenache, Cinsault and Syrah grapes. The nose is dominated by intense aromas of orange peel, white peach, strawberry and red cherry. This light and crisp rosé can complement a meal perfectly or be delightful on its own. Pairs well with light appetizers or spicy tapas.",
