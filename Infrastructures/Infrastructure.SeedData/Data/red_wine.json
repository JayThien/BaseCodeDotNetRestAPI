Aromas of blackberry and faint dried herb waft up from the rim towards you. Upon tasting, the wine has a broad and pleasant entry, moving to a focused and weighty mid palate with notes of cassis, toast and graphite.

    "Name": "MONTES PURPLE ANGEL",
    "Description": "The grapes for Purple Angel come from Montes’ own vineyards in Apalta and Marchigüe, arguably two of the finest sites in the Colchagua Valley. In Apalta, vines are planted on 45° slopes, providing good exposure to achieve ripeness. Cool ocean breezes and low nighttime temperatures moderate this warm area, permitting slow development and retention of varietal aromas and acidity. Marchigüe is slightly cooler because of its closer proximity to the ocean. Conditions are dry, reducing the threat of fungal disease and resulting in consistently healthy harvests. All grapes were hand harvested.Purple Angel displays the rich flavours typical of Carménère. The addition of Petit Verdot gives spice, colour, structure and acidity. Deep ruby red in colour, the wine has alluring red and blackberry notes on the nose. The palate is densely concentrated, with spice and mocha lingering on the finish.",
